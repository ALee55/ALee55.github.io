    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>	My name is Andrew Lee, currently living and studying in Pittsburgh.  I am a full-time student in my second year at the University of Pittsburgh and majoring in Architecture/engineering.  I really like organizing/designing and building/structures stood out to me the most in terms of design.  My family and I live in PA and I would be the oldest and the first first-generation student in my family.  I really enjoy mingling and talking with friends but if Iâ€™m alone I like to just browse videos or listen to and play music.  My favorite thing to do would be just playing guitar and learning new arrangements/songs to pass the time or simply go around cleaning/organizing the house. </p>
