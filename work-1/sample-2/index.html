        <h2>Envisioning Your Design</h2>
        <!--<p>Work in Progress 1 begins here</p> -->
        <p>	For my website’s design, I think I would like to keep it simple and minimalistic and add a little icon or logo that represents me to hint at who I am.  For me personally, a website is engaging if there isn’t any source of confusion in the website format and is well organized for people to navigate and quick to get used to.  It would be aesthetically pleasing to look at and use if the design and the color are not so bright but more towards pastel and colors with variations rather than neon solid colors.  It would be easy to use if the style of the website is consistent throughout and the menus and the sub-menus mostly fit into one view and not much scrolling or changing the page is necessary, unless if its to continue its contents.  I’m not sure how to describe how it would be best impressive/memorable, but it would be nice if there isn’t too much decoration/design on the website that it would be overbearing but enough make it look soothing and consistent with the theme while not looking like a google doc page.  I think I’ll be leaning towards an overall library theme or something towards that area to mimic the shelves and organization that is back to back to look fit and give off a wooden vibe.  To fit the wooden theme but not look so boring I’ll probably add in a logo that is an instrument.  It’ll also be cool if the log itself could be a link to the main or an important core page for the website itself.  I would like the font to be a font that everyone can read clearly, not some font that has a certain style to look aesthetic but can be confusing.  The color scheme would be overall consistent and pastel and not much popping out.  I would like the transition between the pages to be connecting and simply smooth.  I’ll most likely have a sidebar or all the links on one side and lined up.  The images or illustrations would be minimal but points out each characteristic I’m trying to make clear.
