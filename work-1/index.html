        <h2>Written Reflection 1</h2>
        <p>Starting this project was a struggle itself as I had some internal issues that conflicted with the school scheduling and due to that conflict, I was switching out of classes and was late to this one.  Though I thought was a simple reading composition class similar to the one that I took during my freshman year, it was much different than that and making a website wasn’t as fun or easygoing that I thought it would be.  Of course, it was given that as I came late and I had to catch up.  However it was also fun thinking and creating a personal website, and brainstorming ideas for it wasn’t bad at all.  Learning the basics of programming or just the HTML itself and then putting in commands was also busy work and didn’t make sense at times.</p>
        <p>I've never taken a CS class before and it was pretty frustrating at first.  Learning about all these rules and functions, as well as the abstract concepts to make it look better.  It felt just like busy work as I’m copying and pasting the index to all the folders and changing the little things and then having to change everything else.  Honestly, once you watched the videos multiple of times and trying it out and watching extra videos online it wasn’t so bad doing the actual coding itself.  When I clicked that green commit button and refreshed my page and it changed it was very satisfying.  There were many times when I was refreshing over and over again trying to figure out why it wasn't working and what was wrong only to find out that I was missing a semi-colon after an hour.</p>
        <p>Choosing the color scheme and thinking about what to do with the actual website was pretty fun as it seemed like I was doing and learning something that I could apply in my life, and it felt like I was coding.  Though there are little details and aspects that I want to add to the website like photo links, color variations, sidebars, dropdowns, etc. to make it seem like its mine and no one else could just simply copy it, though, in theory, you can.</p>
        <p>I wonder if I’m using what I learned in class into actual usage into my page like all the effects and topics that we are now learning in our Pecha Kuchas.  Doing mine on layering, right now I’m not putting much use of it, as well as the rules for specific formats.  Though honestly I’m not sure if I can I want to make use of effects like the usability, and the spacing rule, to simply at least make it look all sorted out and organized to fit my music/library theme.</p>
        <p>I know which direction and what I want to do with my website but its just that will I or can I. I know that I can if I put my real-time and constant effort into it and if I long for it.  Starting to learn photoshop and getting into in class was exciting despite coding, it would be a program that I’m going to have to familiarize myself with in the future for design and visual usage.  I already knew of the basic controls on the website like the paint and the crops, but now I'm getting into more features like the fills, layers, visual shading, etc.  since ill be using in the future to design houses and probably in a future class, it's nice getting into it and get accustomed to it so I can play around it in the future of my violation and for fun.</p>
        <p>For the conclusion at this point, I at least want to have the general outline down to keep it simple but organized like having the headings and the links at the right place and font, as well as the color somewhat related to what I’m going for.  Going as of right now, I just need to get myself used to and memorize what goes where.  It now dawns on me how hard it can get just making and designing a website can be, disregarding the contents itself.  Though it is very frustrating that I don’t have what I want on the page at the moment, learning the HTML, CSS, Github, etc. is very useful, to say the least, and its definitely a good thing to have in my arsenal of skills for the future.  Now it's just that I have to actually put it into motion and use.</p>
