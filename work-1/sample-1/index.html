        <p>Amazon Review: Mechanical Pencil</p>
        <p>This was such a great buy!  This pencil literally never runs out of ink and I never had to change the cartridge for the ink, but instead, I just bought a new one because it kept getting shorter and shorter as time goes by.  It’s really nice to use because the writing is very clear and has multiple font options as you write.  It lasts for a really long time even if you use it for everything in replacement for your other writing tools.  The pencil itself also has an eraser at the end attached to it which helps immensely in multi-purpose writing and considering the price of it being so high for this one single tool, it’s is definitely worth it.  I hope there will be more products like this that replaces my already own tools ad make my work so much easier and better looking.</p>
