        <h2>Written Reflection 2</h2>
        <p>Working on this second part of the Github site was pretty difficult to work and the social problems happening around the world did not help at all.  Just while doing work and going through the semester, spring break came by real early and then because of the whole COVID-19 situation, the school was canceled and other things started coming up as well.  Disregarding the mental care being thrown out the window and all motivation to do anything just going away with school now being online and everything is recorded, it was hard to get used to, keeping in mind that the rest of my sophomore year and my friends my being scattered and we won’t be meeting again till next school year for all I know so far.  Crazy thing was that some classes took attendance when now that we are home, some of us have different time standards.  Despite the mental things, physically it was also hard to get used to, since my family, relatives, and everyone is now being affected.  My parents unable to properly communicate and get used to things like their jobs closing and paperwork to take care of, they needed help.  It was a constant state of moving around and helping them out.  I had to go around with family to help people move stuff, check if they’re doing well, and now that borders were closing down, mobility is getting even more difficult.  I was home for only a bit for spring break but it didn’t feel like I was having my time of resting.  Before I knew it the break was over and there hasn't been much change since the first Work In Progress.  I don’t know if I can complete it in time but time really flew with everyone panicking and honestly it was already late.</p>
        <p>Now going back to the actual project itself, it was going pretty well since I knew what I was doing and had the contents since it was mostly repetitive.  Though I knew what I was doing, it was all just to fill in the credits and requirements for this assignment, and I didn't know what to do to put my vision and design into the website itself.  Though photoshop was getting easier it was frustrating since the program itself was a paid app, and my free week was running out, and when I tried using the virtual lab on the Pitt website, it was so slow and there were many cases where the virtual lab crashed and disconnected, making me lose work.  I guess I was fortunate since I had friends at Carnegie Mellon that are taking design courses and they could help out.</p>
        <p>Looking at my current work and my website, it looks alright at best, there are no decorations or additional things that pop out, and I think people can just tell from looking at it that it was just for a project in some class.  Though it is very plain and not much is on it, since I’m the one who made it, it did feel like more was there than there were.  For the design and ideas, I have I'm just going to have to ask my design or computer friends to help me or give me the code to apply the designs.</p>
        <p>Since all the assignments and the submenus in the Work In Progress 2 were needing photoshop, I needed to get used to it but even till now there are so many little hidden functions that I don't know about and didn't know they existed.  Some make work easier but too much of it is confusing to track.  The assignments itself was enjoyable at the least, like the Pecha Kucha and the Logo and Branding assignments.  Focusing on one topic in the Pecha Kucha was nice and was pretty easy, though there were some technical difficulties.  The Logo assignment was fun since I was creating a symbol for myself and the website while the other assignments were mostly group projects.  The storyboard was a little troubling and tedious as I head to draw and write the contents on the photoshop itself.  I was doing a lot of outlining with the pen or shapes and then using the fill option and shading a lot.  When I was going between multiple layers to get little bits of details, I felt like it was going pretty well.</p>
        <p>For the conclusion of this Work In Progress 2, it was pretty hectic.  All of my other classes now being online and with the tests and assignments also being online.  Working at home did not help either with the loss of motivation and being so unexpectantly active despite being a break., lot of wearing masks and being careful.  I guess from the other end, it should be helping me out now that I’m quarantined at home, so technically ill have more time to do work.</p>
