        <h2>Logo and Branding</h2>
        
        <p>Because I am heavily into music and playing an instrument is one of my biggest hobbies, I think I’m going to go for something towards that area.  It would most likely be related to something of the string instrument since my main instrument is a guitar.  It could be also something like the bass or ukelele.  Though there is already an app or company that embodies this pretty well, it could make a better change and embody more things and more instruments for people to learn and enjoy playing music.  The purpose of this company will be to provide assistance in playing/learning music and the instruments that can be played with recording instruments, the guitar being the most prominent and familiar ones.  It would give the user a feeling that this is a string instrument library, as it provides tips, lessons, tabs, and options to record or loop, and etc.</p>
        <p>Guitar or string instrument being a common one, and the one already being used the most, I’ll be editing and messing around with the shape of a guitar pick, and try to change up the colors or the drawings that can be added into the logo itself to symbolize and show what this app is for.</p>
