        <p>Preparation to go back into the stormy battlefield to support shoot the finishing shot despite heavy artillery and gunships reign fire endlessly.  Hope for survival is minuscule but retreating is not an option.</p>
        <p>At first, I was planning on combining and playing with sounds that are soothing and relaxing to hear in a library or inside a comfy home which would have fit my theme.  I first ran across the sound of rain which is relaxing and people like to hear when stuck inside a home so that they could read a book or simply relax and spend the day.  However, I thought that was too cliche and decided to turn them 180 degrees where the atmosphere is uncomfortable, full of tension, and desperate that could also fit with the rain.  The sound of the rain and bombing/artillery in the background allows the people think of a battlefield right away, and the key point, which was the “assembling of a gun” amidst of heavy artillery, reminds the hearer to realize that he or she is getting ready to go back into the battlefield and shoot the shot.  In comparison, this preparation of firearm to go into the battlefield can similarly resemble students going into a library and picking a book to prepare and ready for their upcoming battles; exams/projects, to win the war; semester, and afterward get their medal of honor; grades.</p>
        
        <h3>Genre Association and Representation</h3>
        <p>If I had to remake an existing work/genre like a movie poster into a different genre, I would first look at the poster itself and know what the movie is about so that I could decide whether it should be changed to something similar or very different.  Some themes would work well together, like action to horror or horror into a documentary.  There is no real rule to what genre can be altered into though there may be easier ones but that all depends on what is chosen as the starting medium.  I had the movie genre of topic horror and I decided to switch it into the genre: comedy since it would not be so difficult to do and it would be fun to work within the process also.  I played around with the color scheme of the background so that it gives off more of a relaxed and humourous vibe rather than the dark and creepy vibe it gave off before.  The movie our group chose was The Shining, and we picked a specific scene where the movie can be recognized by and I added wordings and little variation of the picture itself where it would be more humorous.  I tried to change colors on the person’s skin tone and background while adding the title and captions where it seems off and unexpected to make it seem funny when the picture seems serious and creepy.</p>
        <h3>Website Design and Format</h3>
        <p>The website format and the design were so that it would appeal to the audience in a way where nothing is overbearing it doesn’t come off as crowded.  The theme that it went for was neat and organized, while soothing and easily accessible and interpretable while being very minimal while trying to mimic the vibe of a library in a way how it's organized to its sections.  The color was chosen with its yellowish/brown tone to mimic a library’s wooden frame or background, and the font was chosen because of its smooth curvature but it does so in a way that there is no problem in reading each word.  Other aspects like the scale and the margins were so that everything can be seen in one oversight, and there isn’t a need to scroll a lot or go into consecutive links unless there was a need to be, which is to go to a different project/topic.  If I was to add more links and different contents into my website which would lead me to add more links or even designs like box headings, drop-downs, or images, I could have played around with more variations of colors and scale to make it fit the theme of a library a little bit more.</p>
        <h3>Adobe Photoshop to Emphasize</h3>
        <p>In the photoshop project, I chose a picture of a hand holding a paintbrush that had paint dripping off of it.  Via photoshop I altered the photo and played around with its color to make the picture have a bit more realism and quality.  Before it was more of a picture that was mostly black, white, and grey, and I altered it so that it uses a real brighter color and makes it show that it was a poster about color and it would pop out more when looking at it.  The color itself was also altered so that it wasn’t just a constant color but it had a variation of the color to make it seem like the potency of the color is fading as it leaves the paintbrush.  After that, I also went and played around with the shading and fading of the colors and the fonts to make it fade in and sponge-like where it then made the poster look like it was painted rather than make it seem like it was digitally produced.</p>
        <h3>Storyboard Activity</h3>
        <p>The storyboard activity was one that was getting frustrating more so than other projects because of its every attentiveness to each panel of the storyboard.  Multiple storyboard formats were tried then settled for the suitable one then I chose the topic to be on the Pecha Kucha topic that I worked on previously, which was Layering.  It was hard because I initially had no real knowledge of how to use photoshop that would make this process easier, and having to draw and write on the storyboard format was hard without having a tool that can make it easier, which lead me to just use my mouse.  In the end, I had to resort in images and drawings that took minimal effort but that could show what it was supposed to be, which was accompanied by writing to explain what the Layering is.  It was hard in a way where I didn’t know the controls and keys to alter the image to be in the right space or order.  In the end, I resorted to getting help from a friend who then taught me the general and key shortcuts on the keyboard which would make things easier and progress faster.</p>
        <h3>Logo and Branding</h3>
        <p>The logo/branding project was the one that I was most interested in/proud about, more so because of the concept of making a logo/brand.  This was a fun and proud work cause the logo that I would be working on would symbolize what the website as a whole was trying to go for.  Though the contents of my current website can’t fully fulfill what the logo that I made currently is, it was still fun making it.  It combined the things and concepts that I like and wanted to show and was made into an image where it can then be showcased without words.  Because I chose a guitar pick to be the shape and the image contained within was to give the theme of the message, it could be taken and made into a custom pick where it could be used in real use.  This concept of a logo or brand is useful for future work since it is a quick and effective way to symbolize my work and each aspect of a project can be put into images where it can then be further interpreted.</p>
